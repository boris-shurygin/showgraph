Nodes have editable labels and edges can be routed using control points. One of primary goals was to create lightweight and easy-to-use tool for fast construction of a graph's visual representation. Showgraph features an auto-layout for directed graphs.`The project is in stage of development. However it can already be used for graph construction and visualization. Any suggestions for the tool are appreciated.` |

Here are some examples: a colored control flow graph and example of graph depth-first search result (after illustration 7.9 "Advanced Compiler Design" by Steven S. Muchnick)

Showgraph is also capable of parsing compiler dumps ( x86 GCC and ICC compilers currently) and displaying CFG along with text dump for user-selected basic blocks. This allows for using it as an IR browser.
