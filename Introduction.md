# Introduction #
There is no _real_ manual for [ShowGraph](http://code.google.com/p/showgraph), but these wiki pages describe most features that you will need when editing graphs.

ShowGraph can be used in two ways:
  1. [Graph Editor/Viewer](GraphEdition.md)
  1. [IR viewer](IRBrowsing.md)

Using ShowGraph as an editor you can create diagrams and graphs and export them as pictures. ShowGraph saves its graphs in [simple XML-derived format](GraphFiles.md). These XML files can be generated by other software in order to use ShowGraph as a viewer. ShowGraph also features an auto-layout for directed graphs. Once you have constructed graph you can use automatic layout to provide a basic structured view that can be further adjusted manually to produce nicer image of the graph.

ShowGraph can be used as IR viewer to open compiler IR dumps and browse them. This makes sense for compiler developers or students. ShowGraph has parsers for IR prints of GCC 4 and ICC.
