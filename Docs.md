# Documents #
> Documents in this section are created by developer for himself. The purpose of these docs is simply for writing down the design details.

> Documents are dedicated to overall problem statement, initial requirement, UI design, architecture, development notes, modules overviews and algorithms description.
> Currently most of the pages do not exist or are in draft stage. Although the prototype was implemented without any design docs, next version is going to be better documented as I am trying to make it usable for the others...
