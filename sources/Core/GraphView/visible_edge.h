/**
 * @page vedge Visible Edge Class
 * 
 * Visible Edge Class
 * VEdge stands for "visible edge". It is a class for manipulating
 * an edge like the user see it. The need for this stems from
 * the fact that edge seen by user is actually composed of 
 * several low-level edges between pseudo nodes.
