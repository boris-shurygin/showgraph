 * Drawing graph on a 2D plane is done via Sugiyama-like algorithm. 
 * Drawing is done in two steps:
 * - Ranking, wich defines vertical position of every node and inserts
 *   pseudo nodes on edges that span across multiple levels.
 * - Horizontal placement, wich uses barycenter heuristic to position a node close
 *   to the nodes connected with it on other levels
