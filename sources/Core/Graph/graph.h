/**
 * @class Graph
 * @brief Basic representation of graph
 * @ingroup GraphBase
 *
 * @par 
 * The Graph class represents graph as a whole. As one can expect graph has @ref Node "nodes"
 * and @ref Edge edges which impement the directed graph data structure. For traversing nodes
 * and edges they are linked in two lists. One can traverse these lists using firstNode() and firstEdge()
 * routines with calling Node::nextNode() Edge::nextEdge() in a loop.
 * Example:
 * @code
 //Traversing nodes
 for ( Node *n = firstNode(); isNotNullP( n); n = n->nextNode())
 {
     ...
 }
 //Traversing edges
 for ( Node *e = firstEdge(); isNotNullP( e); e = e->nextEdge())
 {
     ...
 }
 @endcode
 * The same result can be achieved using macros 
 * @code
 
 // Graph *g; Node *n; Edge *e;
 // Traversing nodes
 foreachNode( n, g)
 {
    ...
 }
 
 // Traversing edges
 foreachEdge( e, g)
 {
    ...
 }
 @endcode
 *
 * @par
 * The graph is also owner of memory allocated for its nodes and edges. This is
 * implemented via @ref FixedPool "memory pools" with records of fixed size. Nodes and
 * Edges should be created through newNode() and newEdge() routines. They can be deleted by
 * deleteNode() and deleteEdge() routines. Do not use operators new/delete for graph's 
 * nodes and edges.
 * 
 * @par
 * Graph is also manager of @ref Mark "markers" and @ref Nums "numerations" for nodes and edges.
 * New @ref Marker "marker" can be obtained by newMarker() routine. New @ref Numeration "numeration" is
 * created by newNum().
 * Example:
 * @code
 //Graph *graph; Node *n;
 Marker m = graph.newMarker();
 Numeration num = graph.newNum();
    
 GraphNum i = 0; //unsigned int 32
 //Mark nodes without predecessors
 foreachNode( n, g)
 {
    if ( isNullP( n->firstPred()))
    {
        n->mark( m);
        n->setNumber( num, i++);
    }
 }
 ...

 //Checking markers and numbers
 foreachNode( n, g)
 {
     if ( n->isMarked( m) && n->number( num) > 10)
     {
        ...
     }
 }
 graph->freeMarker( m);
 graph->freeNum( num);

 @endcode
 *
 * @par Deriving classes from Graph
 * To make a graph-like data structure one can use Graph as a base class. Most likely
 * it will be also necessary to implement two more classes to make a useful implementation.
 * These two class should be derived from Node and Edge to represent information  
 * associated with nodes and edges. You can see an example of such inheritance in AGraph,
 * ANode and AEdge classes.
 *

 * @sa Edge
 * @sa Mark
 * @sa Nums
